# Repeat BFS Activity

This repository is the classroom activity for the Graphs Pt. 1 Roundtable in Unit 4.

## Learning Goals 
- Practice converting a list of edges into an adjacency list.
  
## One-Time Activity Setup

Follow these directions once, at the beginning of the activity:


1. Navigate to the folder where you wish to save activities. This could be your `projects` folder, or you may want to create a new folder for all of your activities.

   If you followed Ada's recommended file system structure, you can navigate to your projects folder with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Developer/projects
   ```

   Or, if you want to create a new folder for all of your activities:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Developer
   $ mkdir activities
   $ cd activities
   ```

   If you've already created an activities directory, you can navigate to it with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~/Developer/activities
   ```

2. In Github click on the "Fork" button to fork the repository to your Github account.  This will make a copy of the activity in your Github account. 

3. "Clone" the activity into your working folder. This command makes a new folder named for the activity repository, and then puts the activity into this new folder.

   ```bash
   $ git clone <clone_url_for_the_activity>
   ```

   The `<>` syntax indicates a placeholder. You should replace `<clone_url_for_the_activity>` with the actual URL you'd use to clone this repository. If you click the green "Code" button on the GitHub page for this repository, you'll see a URL that you can copy to your clipboard.
 
   Use `ls` to confirm there's a new activity folder

4. Move your location into this activity folder

   ```bash
   $ cd <repository_directory>
   ```

   The `<repository_directory>` placeholder should be replaced with the name of the activity folder. If you're not sure what the folder is named, remember that you can use `ls` to list the contents of your current location.

5. Create a virtual environment named `venv` for this activity:

   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   ```

6. Activate this environment:

   ```bash
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Verify that you're in a python3 virtual environment by running:
   
   - `$ python --version` should output a Python 3 version
   - `$ pip --version` should output that it is working with Python 3

7. Install dependencies once at the beginning of this activity with

   ```bash
   # Must be in activated virtual environment
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Not all activities will have dependencies, but there will still be an included `requirements.txt` file.

Summary of one-time activity setup:
- [ ] Fork the activity repository
- [ ] `cd` into your working folder, such as your `projects` or `activities` folder
- [ ] Clone the activity onto your machine
- [ ] `cd` into the folder for the activity
- [ ] Create the virtual environment `venv`
- [ ] Activate the virtual environment `venv`
- [ ] Install the dependencies with `pip`

## Activity Development Workflow

1. When working on this activity, always ensure that your virtual environment is activated:

   ```bash
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. If you want to work on another project from the same terminal window, you should deactivate the virtual environment when you are done working on the activity:

   ```bash
   $ deactivate
   ```

## Class Activity

### Repeat BFS
Problem Statement:

You are provided a sample implementation of the basic version of breadth first search from Learn (with a small modification). Alter the `repeat_bfs` function so that it starts traversing from the first node in the adjacency dictionary and finds all of the nodes in the graph, even if it is a disconnected graph. 

Each graph will contain nodes from 1 -> n. Keep in mind some of the nodes may be connected to the first node in the adjacency dictionary, and others may be "islands" or disconnected from the first node in the dictionary. 

### Example 1
*Input*:

    graph = {
        1: [],
        2: [],
        3: []
    }

*Output*: 

    [1, 2, 3]

Explanation:

- According to our adjacency dictionary, none of our nodes are connected. They are all islands so we simply loop through each node and add it to our result list.

### Example 2
*Input*:

    graph = {
        1: [2],
        2: [1],
        3: [4],
        4: [3]
    }

*Output*: 

    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
  
## Running Tests
Use the tests provided in the `test_repeat_bfs.py` file to verify that your code is working correctly. You can verify the tests are working in one of two ways:

1. Run `pytest` in the terminal (make sure you are in the venv!)
2. Set up the testing environment in the VSCode Testing Pane
   1. Click on the beaker icon and click `Configure Python Tests`
   2. Select `pytest` from the list that appears
   3. Select `tests` from the new list that appears.
3. Verify the tests show up in the Testing Pane.
4. Run the tests to make sure they are all passing!
